# MolarMassPython
The chemistry thingy I did Sophomore year

It only runs once at a time, but here's the gist:

A) Type in a molecular formula (without parentheses!), like CHCOO3 or SiO4

B) press enter

C) It will report a few things:
   - The molar mass of the entire molecule
   - The % weight contributed by each type of element
   - The combined weight of each type of element
   - If applicable, the common name of the molecule

Later implementations will have comments describing the process

Later implementations will also have a looping ability and more common names of molecules
